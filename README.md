# InfoVis-HW-3

Welcome, this project presents some Visualizations that depict Outlier Detection for AI/ML Algorithms using heatmap techniques on 3 different datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
### to start the project you want to download all the dependencies as follows:
- [Download Node.js!](https://nodejs.org/en)
- ensure that node is installed and ensure the node package manager is there as well (test `node -v` and test `npm -v`)
- ensure that the react javascript framework is on your computer

### Additional libraries in the project
This project uses:
- [MUI Library](https://mui.com/)

### To start the project!
unpackage the zip and enter the directory of the project (hw-3-webpage folder)
once you've navigated to the directory of this project then start a development server with react:
command: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
afterwards ensure that a server has been hosted http://localhost/3000 and enter into a web browser to access the project!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
